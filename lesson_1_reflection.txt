How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?
Viewing a diff between two versions of a file helped me to see the bug, because
it limited the possibilities to only that lines, which have changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

I don't know.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
